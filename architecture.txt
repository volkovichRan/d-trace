The Dtrace consumers execute in user mode and use the libdtrace.so library. 
When a D program is executed the program is complied into byte code. 
The actual code is validated for safety and executed in the kernel in a virtual machin-like 
enviroment that is part of the kernel. 
dtrace framework includes an emulated cpu suppriting an risc instruction set.
The internal implementation includes interfaces between the kernel framework and the providers.
when the D program teminates the providers disable the probes, restoring all 
the insturmented code paths to their original states.
